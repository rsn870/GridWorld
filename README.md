# GridWorld
An implemenation for Grid World a popular test environment where we can test RL algorithms 

The Grid World implemenation consists of a grid of squares through which pur agent has to navigate . The goal has a very high 
positive reward +100 there are ditches with negative reward , every other square is awarded with a moderate positive penalty and each turn is awarded with a -1 penalty in order to ensure that 
the problem is a finite horizon one and the agent 'learns ' to reach the goal in finite time .

The implemenations are in python 3 and can be easily added .

Also presented are codes for Value Iteartions and Policy Iterations in this environment which can either be used directly 
or for reference if the user intends to write his/her own code for the implementation.

Enjoy playing around with environment 

Happy Coding !
